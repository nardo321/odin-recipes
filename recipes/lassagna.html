    <p>Lasagna is a popular Italian dish made with layers of wide flat pasta noodles, 
        tomato sauce, meat (usually ground beef), and cheese (typically ricotta, mozzarella, 
        and Parmesan). The layers are usually assembled in a baking dish and then baked in the oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
        Other ingredients such as vegetables or herbs may be added to the sauce or between the layers of pasta to add flavor and nutrition. 
        Lasagna is often served as a main dish and is a hearty and satisfying meal.
